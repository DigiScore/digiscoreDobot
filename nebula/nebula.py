"""
Embodied AI Engine Prototype AKA "Nebula".
This object takes a live signal (such as body tracking,
or real-time sound analysis) and generates a response that
aims to be felt as co-creative. The response is a flow of
neural network emissions data packaged as a dictionary,
and is gestural over time. This, when plugged into a responding
script (such as a sound generator, or QT graphics) gives
the impression of the AI creating in-the-moment with the
human in-the-loop.

     It generates data in response to incoming percpts
    from human-in-the-loop interactions, and responds
    in-the-moment to the gestural input of live data.
    There are 4 components:
        Nebula: as "director" it coordinates the overall
            operations of the AI Factory
        AIFactory: builds the neural nets that form the
            factory, coordinates data exchange,
            and liases with the common data dict
        NebulaDataClass: is the central dataclass that
            holds and shares all the  data exchanges
            in the AI factory
        Affect: receives the live percept input from
            the client and produces an affectual response
            to it's energy input, which in turn interferes
            with the data generation.
